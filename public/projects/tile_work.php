<h1 class="hidden">Tile Work</h1>

I have worked for a couple of flooring companies for over ten years. I calculate that I have put in over 20 miles of tile pieces in that time. These are among the types of jobs I've done. I used to joke with people that the tiles keep getting bigger and bigger and that some day they will ask me to do a floor in one piece...One of my clients hired me to put in a $20,000. one piece (a mat) 12' x 10' hand made Persian mosaic tile floor in their entry. It was definitely no joking matter.
