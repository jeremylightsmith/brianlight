<h1 class="hidden">Brian's Own Home</h1>

I was the contractor for my own home. While I hired out some of the larger projects to keep this within time restraints I did do most of the costly components: The plumbing, electrical, trim and railings, painting, tile, and finished the entire basement. With the architects miscalculations I redesigned, repaired, and recalculated to insure all elements fit together smoothly.

Six months to build.
