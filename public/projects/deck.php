<h1 class="hidden">Deck</h1>

There was a small deck that came with the home. I added onto the existing deck and put on new stairs. The owners liked it so much they requested a larger deck so they may host larger parties. I took all the decking off and added more length, moved the stairs to the end, and reworked the entire railing. I also fashioned a gate to keep the small grand kids from getting away.
